# ECE120 Note

This is a website I developed during my time as a teaching assistant for ECE120 at the ZJUI Institute.

You can access the website by clicking [MyWiki](https://gooosy.github.io/Mywiki/) or visiting <https://gooosy.github.io/Mywiki/> for more details.

Unfortunately, due to time limit, I was unable to complete the entire project. The website currently covers only the first three chapters of the course. For the remaining content, I used ppt to deliver review sessions in my dicussion.

In my opinion, the most exciting part of ECE120 is the content that follows the FSM, which delves into the underlying principles of computers using the LC3 as an example.

If you are interested in accessing additional ECE120 materials or would like to contribute to this wiki, feel free to reach out to me via email at <siyuan1.23@intl.zju.edu.cn>.
